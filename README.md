# Battleship game in Vite + React

This project was created by Erik Borgstr√∂m as an assigment from QSoftWerk.

The project is a traditional battleship game where the user can play against another player on the same computer. It is built using Vite + React framework and therefore Vitest for testing purposes. 

The project has been created in about 9 hours of coding with project setup included.

In the setup a pipeline for git was also setup that runs test and linters for each push.

## Continues development

If there was more time for the project, more focus would be placed on testing, there is unfortunately some modules that have been seen past and sadly one of the biggest (gameLogic). I would also focus on refactoring the code a bit as it could be made a little better, shorting down functions and so on. I would also want to comment a bit more.

Otherwise, I am happy with the UI and the functionality of the game, and it runs smoothly. I would however but some focus on making it more dynamic so it works better for different sized screens, as it hasn't even been tested for that as of now.

Overall I am happy about it went considering it was only around 9 hours.
